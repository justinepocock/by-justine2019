    <div class="intro">
      <p>Friday afteroon, Maygen - the Marketing Manager at work asked me if I had written a piece about my push for accessibility at Code Enigma, which she could share for IWD2020, I hadn't written anything. I can't really think of anything, it'll happen but not now.

    <div class="reading-line">
      <p>What I can write about is the strong women in my life. Them that quietly build up others, fiercly stand by what they believe in, grit their teeth when others keep failing to understand the harm they cause with the words they use.</p>

      <h2>Strong women</h2>
      <p></p>

      <h2>What I've learned</h2>
        <ul><li><p>There's no harm in being called obsinante if you are right. Keep standing fast in your beliefs.</p>
        </li><li><p>Look out for each other and ACTUALLY help. There's no time left of hollow meaningless words disguised as empathy.</p>
        </li></ul>

      <h2>In conclusion </h2>
      <p>All the cliches work, strong women push other women, behind every strong woman is herself...  </p>
