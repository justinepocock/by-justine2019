      <p>I make websites for people. Those that need the website to share their
        message with the world and the people who need to hear that message.
      </p>
      <p> I believe in people coming together to make great things and thos great
         things only happen when we really know the story which needs to be told.
         So here is my story.

      <h2>Growing up</h2>
      <!-- <p>My school report always read something along the lines of "bubbly child, plays wells with others, keen to learn, always willing to help". Yours probably did too.</p> -->
      <p>
        I'm a strong believer of the James Victore saying "The things that made
        you weird as a kid, make your great today". Having spent some time with
        him mentoring me, I've put a lot of work into realising what makes me
        great today.<span class="pink">*</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's been a long journey getting myself to where I am now, in a position
        to offer my services without the security blanket of an agency.
