  <!--  So you're having a little snoop about I see, well come on in,
        there is some random going on in here, big plans in the works,
        shamelessly commented out for all to see.

        The idea is that I'll make a  Drupal 8 theme and move my old site content
        to it, but I don't have the time right now, and I fancied a new lick of
        paint so started with an MVP of this calling card.

    <p>Having worked with high profile Drupal websites, such as Chatham House, University of Oxford, STEM Learning and Royal Agricultural University, I am currently leading a design team into maturity within a successful Drupal agency. This has included defining processes to ISO 9001 Quality Management System standards for many aspects of the company, including integrating design and UX into DevOps and creating a DesignOps service manual.</p>

<p>I am passionate about helping others excel in this industry, and have spoken at many conferences about design and mindfulness. </p>
